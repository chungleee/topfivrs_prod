# TopFivRs

## STACK

 Front-end: React, React-Router
 Back-end: Express (Node.js)
 Database: Mongoose

## TODOS:

  1. Implement a modal that describes the selected business in details
  2. Perhaps Redux if I decide to scale the app furthermore

### Overall goal of this app

This is my first personal project ever completed. I had no idea what to build until I opened Yelp one time to look for restaurant recommendations and got overwhelmed with all the options. So to give a peace of mind, I built this in order to fetch the top 5 restaurants/bars/cafes nearby and at the cheapest cost.

As this is mainly to desmonstrate what I can do as a developer, I put in functionalities that weren't necessarily important for the app.

### Users can:

  - Register
  - Login
  - Remain logged in until JWT token expires
  - Enter its' current location address and fetch the requested option

### Struggles

  - Authentication
  - Protected routes on the front-end
